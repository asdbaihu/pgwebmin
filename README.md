# PGWebmin
Web based administrative interface for PostgreSQL

## Deployment modes

PGWebmin should be deployable as a desktop app, or as a web based service on a server.

### Desktop Deployment

Use [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) for desktop deployments.  This will need to run in 'single user' mode for storing and accessing settings.

### Service Deployment 

Node and React/Fluxxor web based, server deployed app

## I can see the future

Super ambitiously, we can create react native views for a mobile (iOS and Android) deployment.
